- `assets`: This folder includes screenshots that provide proof of task completion, including on the EXTRACT section.
- `data`: This directory contains raw CSV files for `payments`, `riders`, `stations`, and `trips`.
- `scripts`: This folder contains the SQL scripts used to create the database tables in the star schema.
- `solutions`: This folder documents the solutions for tasks 1 through 6. Each task is addressed in detail, with explanations, code, and methodology used to achieve the projectâ€™s outcomes.

## Project Overview
- The dataset looks like this

- The goal of this project is to develop a data warehouse solution using Azure Synapse Analytics:
    - Design a star schema based on the business outcomes
    - Import the data into Synapse
    - Transform the data into the star schema
    - View the reports from Analytics

**The Business Outcomes:**
1. Analyze how much time is spent per ride
    - Based on date and time factors such as day of week and time of day
    - Based on which station is the starting and/or ending station
    - Based on age the rider at time of the ride
    - Based on whether the rider is a member or a casual rider
2. Analyze how much money is spent
    - Per month, quarter, year
    - Per member, based on the age of the rider at account start
3. EXTRA CREDIT - Analyze how much money in spent per member
    - Based on how many rides the rider averages per month
    - Based on how many minutes the rider spends on a bike per month
