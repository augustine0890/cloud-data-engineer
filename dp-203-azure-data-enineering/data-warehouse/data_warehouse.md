- Data warehouse: a central storage of information that can be queried and used for analysis
    - Optimize data analysis processes and gathers data from multiple sources.
- Operational DBs:
    - Too slow for analytics, too many joins
    - Too hard to understand
- Technical Perspective:
    - Extract the data from the source systems used for operations, transform the data, and load it into a dimensional model.
        - The dimensional model is designed to make it easy for business users to work with the data and improve analytical queries performance.
        - The technologies used for storing dimensional models are different than traditional technologies.
    - Business-user-facing application are needed, with clear visuals (BI) apps.
- Fact tables: columns record events recorded in quantifiable metrics like quantity of an item, duration of the call, a book rating.
- Dimension tables: columns contain attributes like the store at which an item is purchased, or the customer who made the call.
