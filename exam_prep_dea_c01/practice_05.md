1. S3 offers highly scalable and durable object storage, making it suitable for storing vast amounts of data in a data mesh architecture.
- Athena complements S3 by providing serverless interactive query capabilities, allowing direct SQL querying of data stored in S3 without the need of server provisioning or data loading.
- AWS Lake Formation enhances AWS Glue by providing additional features for centralized data governance. It simplifies the management of data lakes and ensures secure access to data through granular permissions.
2. Glue Crawler is automatically scans data in S3 and other data stores, infers schemas, and creates metadata tables in Glue Data Catalog
- Glue Crawler can handle multiple data formats and automatically keep the catalog updated with changes in the data structure, reducing the need for manual intervention.
3. Amazon Athena Federated Query allows you to directly run SQL queries across multiple data sources. Athena's pay-per-query model and serverless nature also contribute to cost savings, especially for ad-hoc or one-time analytical tasks.
- Redshift Spectrum allows querying data in S3 directly from Redshift, but it doesn't natively support querying data from sources like DynamoDB and RDS.
4. CloudWatch can monitor the health and performance of AWS resources, such as EC2 instance.
- AWS Step Functions can orchestrate the workflow, invoking AWS Lambda functions to perform remediation actions if an instance is unhealthy.
- S3 can be used to store logs of the health check status and actions taken.
- AWS Health provides alerts and remediation guidance for AWS service health, but it’s not specifically designed for individual resource health checks like EC2 instances.
- Amazon Inspector is used for security assessments, not for general health monitoring of EC2 instances.
5. Lake Formation simplifies the process of setting up a secure and well-governed data lake. It provides centralized security management, enabling fine-grained access control to different data resources.
- Lake Formation integrates with other AWS services for data storage and analysis, offering a comprehensive solution for managing and utilizing the data lake.
6. Implementing server-side encryption with AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS) allows the company to define fine-grained permissions on who can use the keys to decrypt the data. By using KMS, they can create a key policy that specifies which IAM users or roles are allowed to use the keys, providing strict enforcement of the decryption permissions.
- SSE-S3 provides encryption but does not allow for the granular control of encryption keys needed to restrict decryption to specific users. It doesn't provide the ability to restrict key usage.
- SSE-C requires customers to manage their keys outside AWS.
- An IAM policy can restrict download permissions but does not by itself control who can decrypt the documents if they are downloaded
7. Trail with data event logging, the company can track and log all write operations (such as PUT, POST, and DELETE actions) made to their S3 bucket. These logs can be directed to another S3 bucket within the same region for storage and analysis.
- CloudTrail provides detailed information about the API calls to S3, including the identity of the API caller, the time of the call, the request parameters, and the response elements. This level of detail is crucial for security and compliance auditing.
- S3 Event Notifications can trigger notifications for various bucket events, including object creation and deletion. However, it is more suited for real-time alerts and integrating with other AWS services like Lambda or SQS.
8. AWS Lake Formation simplifies the management of a data lake and provides fine-grained access control. By registering the S3 bucket as a data lake, the organization can use Lake Formation's row-level security features to ensure that analysts can only access data from their specific region, aligning with privacy regulations.
9. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is a storage class designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. This class is suitable for data with unknown or changing access patterns, as it adjusts the pricing based on the frequency of access.
- S3 Glacier is intended for data archiving with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours.
10. Athena Workgroups provide an effective way to manage query environments and data access within Amazon Athena. By configuring a workgroup in Athena, the company can set up an environment that specifically includes the tables generated using the CTAS (Create Table As Select) feature.
- This setup allows Apache Spark to access and analyze these tables via integration with Athena, leveraging the workgroup configuration. The workgroup can be configured to reference the specific data location and settings pertinent to the CTAS-generated tables, facilitating seamless access for Spark-based analytics.
- Athena Saved Queries allow users to save and reuse SQL queries in Athena. This feature is useful for storing frequently used queries but does not facilitate or enhance the integration of Apache Spark with CTAS-generated tables in Athena. Saved queries are more about query management rather than enabling external analytics integrations.
11. S3 Event Notifications can be configured to trigger automatically when new files are uploaded to an S3 bucket. Setting up S3 Event Notifications to trigger an AWS Lambda function allows the company to start the video transcoding process immediately after a new video is uploaded.
- The Lambda function can handle the transcoding logic, possibly using AWS media conversion services or custom code, and then save the transcoded video to a different S3 bucket. This approach offers a real-time, efficient, and automated solution.
12. AWS CloudTrail Lake is designed specifically for the aggregation, management, and analysis of audit logs across multiple AWS accounts and services. It provides a centralized solution that enables enterprises to consolidate their AWS CloudTrail logs in one place.
- CloudTrail Lake supports advanced query capabilities and long-term log storage, making it suitable for security and compliance auditing in complex environments. This service simplifies log management and analysis, meeting the requirements of the enterprise for a comprehensive and efficient auditing solution.
- AWS Config is primarily used for tracking and recording configuration changes of AWS resources. It focuses more on resource configurations rather than providing a comprehensive log analysis solution.
13. Amazon MemoryDB for Redis is the most suitable service for the gaming company’s requirements. It is a Redis-compatible, fully managed, in-memory database service built for cloud applications that require microsecond latency for read and write operations.
- MemoryDB is designed to provide both high availability and data durability, which are essential for real-time, multiplayer online games like the one described. It supports use cases such as session management and leaderboards, making it an ideal choice for the gaming company’s needs.
14. Amazon Aurora Serverless is a fully managed database service that automatically starts up, shuts down, and scales capacity up or down based on your application's needs. It’s designed for applications with unpredictable workloads, and it integrates with Amazon S3, allowing easy data import/export for further processing.
- Amazon Redshift is a powerful data warehousing service that can now automatically pause and resume; however, it’s optimized for complex analytical queries over large datasets rather than serving as an on-demand operational database.
- Amazon RDS does allow for scaling, but it does not automatically adjust compute resources in real-time in response to active connections, which means it could either under-provision or over-provision resources compared to the serverless model.
15. Performance Insights is an RDS feature that allows for an easy assessment of the database load and helps to identify SQL queries that are consuming excessive CPU resource. By focusing on query-level diagnostics and optimizations, the data engineer can target the root cause of the high CPU utilization and potentially resolve the performance issue without scaling the hardware.
- Upgrading to a larger instance size with more CPU capacity is a direct approach to addressing high CPU utilization. This will provide the database with more computational resources to handle the write-heavy workload, thereby improving the overall performance of the application.
