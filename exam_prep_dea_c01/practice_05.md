1. S3 offers highly scalable and durable object storage, making it suitable for storing vast amounts of data in a data mesh architecture.
- Athena complements S3 by providing serverless interactive query capabilities, allowing direct SQL querying of data stored in S3 without the need of server provisioning or data loading.
- AWS Lake Formation enhances AWS Glue by providing additional features for centralized data governance. It simplifies the management of data lakes and ensures secure access to data through granular permissions.
2. Glue Crawler is automatically scans data in S3 and other data stores, infers schemas, and creates metadata tables in Glue Data Catalog
- Glue Crawler can handle multiple data formats and automatically keep the catalog updated with changes in the data structure, reducing the need for manual intervention.
3. Amazon Athena Federated Query allows you to directly run SQL queries across multiple data sources. Athena's pay-per-query model and serverless nature also contribute to cost savings, especially for ad-hoc or one-time analytical tasks.
- Redshift Spectrum allows querying data in S3 directly from Redshift, but it doesn't natively support querying data from sources like DynamoDB and RDS.
4. CloudWatch can monitor the health and performance of AWS resources, such as EC2 instance.
- AWS Step Functions can orchestrate the workflow, invoking AWS Lambda functions to perform remediation actions if an instance is unhealthy.
- S3 can be used to store logs of the health check status and actions taken.
- AWS Health provides alerts and remediation guidance for AWS service health, but it’s not specifically designed for individual resource health checks like EC2 instances.
- Amazon Inspector is used for security assessments, not for general health monitoring of EC2 instances.
5. Lake Formation simplifies the process of setting up a secure and well-governed data lake. It provides centralized security management, enabling fine-grained access control to different data resources.
- Lake Formation integrates with other AWS services for data storage and analysis, offering a comprehensive solution for managing and utilizing the data lake.
6. Implementing server-side encryption with AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS) allows the company to define fine-grained permissions on who can use the keys to decrypt the data. By using KMS, they can create a key policy that specifies which IAM users or roles are allowed to use the keys, providing strict enforcement of the decryption permissions.
- SSE-S3 provides encryption but does not allow for the granular control of encryption keys needed to restrict decryption to specific users. It doesn't provide the ability to restrict key usage.
- SSE-C requires customers to manage their keys outside AWS.
- An IAM policy can restrict download permissions but does not by itself control who can decrypt the documents if they are downloaded
7. Trail with data event logging, the company can track and log all write operations (such as PUT, POST, and DELETE actions) made to their S3 bucket. These logs can be directed to another S3 bucket within the same region for storage and analysis.
- CloudTrail provides detailed information about the API calls to S3, including the identity of the API caller, the time of the call, the request parameters, and the response elements. This level of detail is crucial for security and compliance auditing.
- S3 Event Notifications can trigger notifications for various bucket events, including object creation and deletion. However, it is more suited for real-time alerts and integrating with other AWS services like Lambda or SQS.
8. AWS Lake Formation simplifies the management of a data lake and provides fine-grained access control. By registering the S3 bucket as a data lake, the organization can use Lake Formation's row-level security features to ensure that analysts can only access data from their specific region, aligning with privacy regulations.
9. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is a storage class designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. This class is suitable for data with unknown or changing access patterns, as it adjusts the pricing based on the frequency of access.
- S3 Glacier is intended for data archiving with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours.
10. Athena Workgroups provide an effective way to manage query environments and data access within Amazon Athena. By configuring a workgroup in Athena, the company can set up an environment that specifically includes the tables generated using the CTAS (Create Table As Select) feature.
- This setup allows Apache Spark to access and analyze these tables via integration with Athena, leveraging the workgroup configuration. The workgroup can be configured to reference the specific data location and settings pertinent to the CTAS-generated tables, facilitating seamless access for Spark-based analytics.
- Athena Saved Queries allow users to save and reuse SQL queries in Athena. This feature is useful for storing frequently used queries but does not facilitate or enhance the integration of Apache Spark with CTAS-generated tables in Athena. Saved queries are more about query management rather than enabling external analytics integrations.
11. S3 Event Notifications can be configured to trigger automatically when new files are uploaded to an S3 bucket. Setting up S3 Event Notifications to trigger an AWS Lambda function allows the company to start the video transcoding process immediately after a new video is uploaded.
- The Lambda function can handle the transcoding logic, possibly using AWS media conversion services or custom code, and then save the transcoded video to a different S3 bucket. This approach offers a real-time, efficient, and automated solution.
12. AWS CloudTrail Lake is designed specifically for the aggregation, management, and analysis of audit logs across multiple AWS accounts and services. It provides a centralized solution that enables enterprises to consolidate their AWS CloudTrail logs in one place.
- CloudTrail Lake supports advanced query capabilities and long-term log storage, making it suitable for security and compliance auditing in complex environments. This service simplifies log management and analysis, meeting the requirements of the enterprise for a comprehensive and efficient auditing solution.
- AWS Config is primarily used for tracking and recording configuration changes of AWS resources. It focuses more on resource configurations rather than providing a comprehensive log analysis solution.
13. Amazon MemoryDB for Redis is the most suitable service for the gaming company’s requirements. It is a Redis-compatible, fully managed, in-memory database service built for cloud applications that require microsecond latency for read and write operations.
- MemoryDB is designed to provide both high availability and data durability, which are essential for real-time, multiplayer online games like the one described. It supports use cases such as session management and leaderboards, making it an ideal choice for the gaming company’s needs.
14. Amazon Aurora Serverless is a fully managed database service that automatically starts up, shuts down, and scales capacity up or down based on your application's needs. It’s designed for applications with unpredictable workloads, and it integrates with Amazon S3, allowing easy data import/export for further processing.
- Amazon Redshift is a powerful data warehousing service that can now automatically pause and resume; however, it’s optimized for complex analytical queries over large datasets rather than serving as an on-demand operational database.
- Amazon RDS does allow for scaling, but it does not automatically adjust compute resources in real-time in response to active connections, which means it could either under-provision or over-provision resources compared to the serverless model.
15. Performance Insights is an RDS feature that allows for an easy assessment of the database load and helps to identify SQL queries that are consuming excessive CPU resource. By focusing on query-level diagnostics and optimizations, the data engineer can target the root cause of the high CPU utilization and potentially resolve the performance issue without scaling the hardware.
- Upgrading to a larger instance size with more CPU capacity is a direct approach to addressing high CPU utilization. This will provide the database with more computational resources to handle the write-heavy workload, thereby improving the overall performance of the application.
16. AWS Glue Data Catalog is a managed service that serves as a central metadata repository compatible with both EMR and Athena. It provides a persistent metadata store for storing table definitions, schemas, and other properties.
- The Glue Data Catalog can import metadata from Apache Hive with minimal effort, eliminating the need for manual configurations or additional infrastructure.
17. AWS DataSync is a data transfer service specifically designed to simplify and accelerate moving large volumes of data between on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services like S3. It provides the ability to schedule periodic or one-time sync tasks, handles incremental changes to keep data in sync, and can be used for both initial migrations and ongoing replication tasks.
- The scheduling feature ensures that data is kept up to date after the initial migration with minimal manual intervention.
- S3 Transfer Acceleration is ideal for speeding up transfers over long distances but doesn't provide the orchestration and automation features needed for scheduled, ongoing data transfers. It focuses on performance rather than synchronization and scheduling capabilities.
18. Aurora Serverless helps to optimize costs by automatically scaling the database capacity with the workload and charging per second for the database capacity used.
- Amazon Redshift is a data warehousing service that offers some scalability, but it is not designed for operational database workloads with unpredictable burst patterns and does not scale as seamlessly as Aurora Serverless.
19. The Amazon Redshift Data API simplifies the process of running queries on a Redshift cluster by allowing applications to execute SQL commands asynchronously and retrieve results with simple API calls.
- The Data API manages the scaling of query execution and connection management, making it an ideal solution for applications that require real-time querying with minimal operational overhead.
20. Using the ALL distribution style for smaller tables, especially those frequently involved in joins, ensures that their data is replicated across all nodes in the Redshift cluster. This approach minimizes data shuffling during query execution, leading to faster query performance.
- For larger tables, maintaining the current distribution style (like EVEN) and optimizing sort keys can help improve query efficiency without the need for additional hardware resources. This strategy is effective in balancing performance and cost, especially in a budget-constrained environment.
21. AWS DataSync is an online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving data between on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services. It's an ideal choice for the research institute because it can securely and efficiently transfer large datasets from their NAS system to AWS, such as to Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS.
- AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection but does not by itself transfer data. It would need to be used in conjunction with another data transfer method. It's more suitable for continuous, regular data transfer needs rather than a one-time migration.
- AWS Snowball is a physical data transport solution, suitable for transferring extremely large amounts of data that might be costly or time-consuming to transfer over the internet.
22. The VACUUM command in Amazon Redshift is used to reclaim space and resort rows in tables where data has been updated or deleted. In Redshift, when rows are deleted or updated, the old versions of rows are logically marked for deletion but not physically removed. Over time, this can lead to inefficient use of disk space and can degrade query performance.
- VACUUM FULL performs both space reclamation and data re-sorting. Space reclamation is important after frequent updates and deletions, as these operations leave behind space that can be compacted.
- The data re-sorting is particularly crucial when using an interleaved sort key, as it can become less effective over time with data changes. The VACUUM FULL command effectively addresses both disk space usage and the need for efficient data processing.
23. Lambda Layers are a way to centrally manage code and libraries that are shared across multiple Lambda functions. By packaging the common Python scripts into a Lambda Layer, the data engineer can easily manage and distribute updates. When the layer is updated, all functions referencing it automatically get access to the latest version. This significantly reduces the manual effort required to update each Lambda function individually whenever the shared scripts change.
24. The Amazon Redshift Data API enables easy and secure access to Redshift from any application without the need to manage database connections. It's suitable for building serverless applications and executing SQL commands asynchronously, making it ideal for scenarios requiring integration with various application environments or when managing batch SQL workloads.
25. S3 Object Lambda allows for the transformation of data as it is retrieved from S3, enabling the redaction of PII before it reaches the end user. Server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys provides robust encryption at rest and allows for detailed access control policies and key usage logging with CloudTrail for compliance and auditing purposes.
- Lifecycle policies and S3 Glacier are useful for managing storage costs and data archiving but do not address the need for dynamic data redaction upon access.
- AWS Config is not designed for real-time access logging and does not support on-the-fly data transformation like S3 Object Lambda.
