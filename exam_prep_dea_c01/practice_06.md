1. PrivateLink is the most appropriate solution for the company's need to securely connect to DynamoDB without using the public internet. PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications, securely on the AWS network.
- By using PrivateLink for DynamoDB, the company ensures that all traffic between their EC2 instances in the VPC and DynamoDB stays within the AWS network.
- AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection from an on-premises environment to AWS. While it can reduce network costs and increase bandwidth, it is not necessary for intra-AWS service communication like connecting EC2 instances to DynamoDB.
2. S3 Standard-IA is designed for data that is accessed less frequently, but when needed, requires rapid access. This storage class offers a lower storage price compared to S3 Standard, while still providing the same low-latency and high-throughput performance. It's ideal for the media company's use case where the images are not accessed frequently after the first month but still require the ability to be accessed quickly.
3. AWS Glue is a managed ETL service that can discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development. It provides built-in transforms, such as DropDuplicates, which can be used to remove duplicate data without the need to write custom code. This solution offers the least operational overhead as it leverages managed services and pre-built transformations.
- Amazon S3 Lifecycle policies are designed to manage objects' life cycles, such as transitioning objects to different storage classes or deleting them after a certain period. They do not provide functionality for data deduplication.
- Athena can identify duplicate records using SQL queries, it's not an ETL service and does not inherently modify or remove data in S3.
4. AWS Data Exchange makes it easy to find, subscribe to, and use third-party data in the cloud. For the e-commerce company looking to incorporate external market research data into their recommendation engine, AWS Data Exchange offers a streamlined way to access and integrate this data.
5. The KMS key policies do not include QuickSight as a principal, hindering decryption of the data queried by Athena.
- QuickSight is not granted the necessary permissions within the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy to access the Athena tables.
6. The `Succeed` state in AWS Step Functions is used to mark a workflow as successful. In this scenario, the architect needs to ensure that the tasks (data extraction, transformation, and loading) are executed in sequence. While `Succeed` itself does not orchestrate the sequence, it is used at the end of the workflow to indicate successful completion of all tasks in the required order.
- The sequential execution of tasks can be managed by the structure of the state machine, where each task transitions to the next upon successful completion, ultimately leading to the `Succeed` state.
- The `Choice` state is used to make decisions within a workflow based on input data, allowing the workflow to branch into different paths. It does not facilitate the sequential execution of tasks.
7. S3 Object Lambda allows you to add custom code to S3 GET requests to modify and process data as it is returned to an application. By using S3 Object Lambda, the company can apply resizing logic to the images stored in S3 on-the-fly, based on the dimensions specified in the user's request.
- S3 Event Notifications are designed to respond to changes in S3 objects, such as creations, deletions, or updates, not direct retrieval requests. This would not be suitable for on-the-fly transformations during data retrieval.
8. For the highest level of control over the encryption process and the keys, the healthcare company should opt for client-side encryption. This approach involves encrypting the data on the client (within the company's internal network) before it is uploaded to S3.
- By managing their own encryption keys, the company ensures that the sensitive patient records are encrypted according to their standards and policies, and they retain full control over the encryption keys. This method aligns with their requirement to encrypt files before they leave the internal network and to manage the keys themselves.
- AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. It does not provide encryption capabilities for S3 objects. The purpose of AWS Shield is different and unrelated to data encryption.
9. Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables secure, no-code data transfer between AWS services and SaaS applications. It's designed to facilitate the flow of data into and out of AWS with minimal configuration.
- With AppFlow, the digital marketing agency can easily connect their SaaS platforms to S3, set up data transfer flows, and schedule them to run at desired intervals without writing and custom integration code or managing underlying infrastructure.
10. The `STL_ALERT_EVENT_LOG` system view is specifically designed to record alerts generated by Redshift query optimizer. It logs various alert events that might indicate performance issues, such as when a query is consuming excessive memory or when it's performing a nested loop join that could be inefficient. Monitoring this system view enables the data engineering team to proactively identify and address potential query performance problems.
- While the `STL_WLM_QUERY` system view provides valuable information about query execution times and whether queries are being queued, it does not directly log the alerts or warnings about query plans or optimization issues
- The `STL_QUERYTEXT` system view contains the text of each executed SQL command, which can be useful for reviewing and debugging queries, but it does not provide alerting or diagnostic information about query performance from the optimizer's perspective.
- The `SVL_QUERY_SUMMARY` system view gives a summary of query execution, including elapsed time and rows processed, which can help in understanding overall performance.
