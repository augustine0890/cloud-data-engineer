1. PrivateLink is the most appropriate solution for the company's need to securely connect to DynamoDB without using the public internet. PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications, securely on the AWS network.
- By using PrivateLink for DynamoDB, the company ensures that all traffic between their EC2 instances in the VPC and DynamoDB stays within the AWS network.
- AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection from an on-premises environment to AWS. While it can reduce network costs and increase bandwidth, it is not necessary for intra-AWS service communication like connecting EC2 instances to DynamoDB.
2. S3 Standard-IA is designed for data that is accessed less frequently, but when needed, requires rapid access. This storage class offers a lower storage price compared to S3 Standard, while still providing the same low-latency and high-throughput performance. It's ideal for the media company's use case where the images are not accessed frequently after the first month but still require the ability to be accessed quickly.
3. AWS Glue is a managed ETL service that can discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development. It provides built-in transforms, such as DropDuplicates, which can be used to remove duplicate data without the need to write custom code. This solution offers the least operational overhead as it leverages managed services and pre-built transformations.
- Amazon S3 Lifecycle policies are designed to manage objects' life cycles, such as transitioning objects to different storage classes or deleting them after a certain period. They do not provide functionality for data deduplication.
- Athena can identify duplicate records using SQL queries, it's not an ETL service and does not inherently modify or remove data in S3.
4. AWS Data Exchange makes it easy to find, subscribe to, and use third-party data in the cloud. For the e-commerce company looking to incorporate external market research data into their recommendation engine, AWS Data Exchange offers a streamlined way to access and integrate this data.
5. The KMS key policies do not include QuickSight as a principal, hindering decryption of the data queried by Athena.
- QuickSight is not granted the necessary permissions within the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy to access the Athena tables.
6. The `Succeed` state in AWS Step Functions is used to mark a workflow as successful. In this scenario, the architect needs to ensure that the tasks (data extraction, transformation, and loading) are executed in sequence. While `Succeed` itself does not orchestrate the sequence, it is used at the end of the workflow to indicate successful completion of all tasks in the required order.
- The sequential execution of tasks can be managed by the structure of the state machine, where each task transitions to the next upon successful completion, ultimately leading to the `Succeed` state.
- The `Choice` state is used to make decisions within a workflow based on input data, allowing the workflow to branch into different paths. It does not facilitate the sequential execution of tasks.
7. S3 Object Lambda allows you to add custom code to S3 GET requests to modify and process data as it is returned to an application. By using S3 Object Lambda, the company can apply resizing logic to the images stored in S3 on-the-fly, based on the dimensions specified in the user's request.
- S3 Event Notifications are designed to respond to changes in S3 objects, such as creations, deletions, or updates, not direct retrieval requests. This would not be suitable for on-the-fly transformations during data retrieval.
8. For the highest level of control over the encryption process and the keys, the healthcare company should opt for client-side encryption. This approach involves encrypting the data on the client (within the company's internal network) before it is uploaded to S3.
- By managing their own encryption keys, the company ensures that the sensitive patient records are encrypted according to their standards and policies, and they retain full control over the encryption keys. This method aligns with their requirement to encrypt files before they leave the internal network and to manage the keys themselves.
- AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. It does not provide encryption capabilities for S3 objects. The purpose of AWS Shield is different and unrelated to data encryption.
9. Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables secure, no-code data transfer between AWS services and SaaS applications. It's designed to facilitate the flow of data into and out of AWS with minimal configuration.
- With AppFlow, the digital marketing agency can easily connect their SaaS platforms to S3, set up data transfer flows, and schedule them to run at desired intervals without writing and custom integration code or managing underlying infrastructure.
10. The `STL_ALERT_EVENT_LOG` system view is specifically designed to record alerts generated by Redshift query optimizer. It logs various alert events that might indicate performance issues, such as when a query is consuming excessive memory or when it's performing a nested loop join that could be inefficient. Monitoring this system view enables the data engineering team to proactively identify and address potential query performance problems.
- While the `STL_WLM_QUERY` system view provides valuable information about query execution times and whether queries are being queued, it does not directly log the alerts or warnings about query plans or optimization issues
- The `STL_QUERYTEXT` system view contains the text of each executed SQL command, which can be useful for reviewing and debugging queries, but it does not provide alerting or diagnostic information about query performance from the optimizer's perspective.
- The `SVL_QUERY_SUMMARY` system view gives a summary of query execution, including elapsed time and rows processed, which can help in understanding overall performance.
11. Use an S3 bucket policy with a condition to allow access exclusively to request that originate from the company's VPC.
12. EventBridge can be used to build event-driven architectures, where it captures events from various sources (like applications, AWS services, and external services), and routes them to the appropriate targets based on content-based rules. This allows for efficient and scalable processing of many events, making it suitable for the team's requirements of handling and routing different types of events for processing and analysis.
- Step Functions is more suited for coordinating complex workflows rather than acting as an event router.
13. Using an AWS Glue crawler with the correct permissions automates the process of cataloging new and modified data files in the Glue Data Catalog. By setting the crawler to run on a daily schedule, the data engineer ensures that the social media engagement data is consistently updated in the catalog with minimal manual intervention.
- Assign an IAM role with necessary Glue permission to the Glue crawler, point it to the S3 bucket's social media data, and set a daily schedule for the crawler.
- AWS Batch is designed for batch computing workloads and not for running Glue crawlers.
- Glue crawlers already have the built-in ability to be scheduled without the need for Step Functions.
14. Use AWS DataSync to automate and schedule the ongoing transfer of files to Amazon S3.
15. AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. It continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations.
- With AWS Config, the company can set up rules to check for compliance with the required configuration and get notified through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) when there's a change that deviates from the compliance standards.
16. Configure S3 Event Notifications to trigger AWS Lambda functions for metadata extraction and storage in DynamoDB.
- This approach is scalable and efficient for handling new files as they arrive in S3. Amazon S3 Event Notifications can trigger AWS Lambda functions to process new files and extract metadata.
17. AWS Glue is a fully managed, serverless ETL service that is ideal for transforming and preparing large datasets for analysis. It can discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development.
- AWS Glue can automate the process of cataloging data, cleaning it, enriching it, and moving it reliably between various data stores. Its serverless nature means the company can scale ETL operations without managing any infrastructure.
18. DynamoDB TTL is a feature that automatically deletes items from a table after a certain time period that you define. By enabling TTL and setting it to 24 hours for the player session data, the company can have DynamoDB automatically remove items that older than 24 hours.
- DynamoDB Streams capture changes to items in a DynamoDB table in near real-time, which can then be used for various purposes like triggering AWS Lambda functions or replicating data. However, Streams do not provide automatic deletion of items based on a time period.
- DynamoDB Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the read and writes capacity of the table to match the workload. While it helps manage throughput and cost, it does not relate to the automatic deletion of items based on their age.
19. Amazon QuickSight is a fast, cloud-powered business intelligence service that makes it easy to build visualizations, perform ad-hoc analysis, and quickly get business insights from data. It can directly connect to various data sources, including Amazon S3, and provides user-friendly tools for creating interactive dashboards.
- QuickSight is designed for users of all skill levels and does not require any servers to set up or manage, making it an ideal choice for the startup company's requirements for easy-to-use data visualization and analysis.
- Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. While it is powerful for querying data, Athena is not a visualization tool.
- AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development. It is primarily used for ETL (extract, transform, load) operations and data cataloging.
- Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. It is used for storing and analyzing large datasets but, like Athena, it is not a visualization tool. Redshift can be used as a data source for visualization tools like Amazon QuickSight but does not provide visualization capabilities on its own
20. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is specifically designed for real-time data streaming and processing. It can continuously capture and store terabytes of data per hour from hundreds of thousands of sources, making it ideal for the fintech company's need to process large streams of transaction data in real-time.
- Kinesis Data Streams supports rapid and continuous data intake and processing, which is essential for the company’s real-time fraud detection system. It enables immediate analysis and response to potentially fraudulent activities as data is streamed.
- While Amazon SQS is a message queuing service that can decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications, it is not optimized for real-time data streaming and processing like Kinesis Data Streams. SQS is more suited for messaging and not for real-time analytics.
21. In Amazon Redshift, adjusting the distribution style to a KEY distribution on a column with high cardinality (which means many unique values) that is frequently used in joins can help balance the data distribution across all nodes more evenly. This can alleviate bottlenecks on a single node and improve overall query performance without the need to increase the number of nodes.
22. S3 Versioning is the most suitable solution for the studio's requirement. It prevents data loss due to overwrites and deletions by keeping multiple versions of an object. When a file is overwritten or deleted, the older version is preserved, allowing for easy recovery. Versioning ensures that all versions of a file are available, with the latest version being readily accessible, aligning with the studio's need to access the most recent files quickly.
- S3 Object Lock in compliance mode provides immutable storage, which is more stringent than needed for this scenario. It's typically used for regulatory requirements where data must not be altered or deleted for a certain period.
23. Amazon S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) is a feature that automatically replicates data from one S3 bucket to another bucket in a different AWS region. This feature is designed to provide a simple and reliable solution for data backup and disaster recovery. 
- By enabling CRR on their S3 bucket, the healthcare company can ensure that all data written to their primary bucket is automatically and seamlessly backed up to a secondary bucket in a different region, fulfilling their regulatory requirements for data redundancy and disaster recovery.
24. Redshift's Query Optimizer can improve the performance of complex query execution, especially for those that are run frequently and involve joins across large tables. By creating materialized views, the team can store the precomputed results of these expensive join operations.
- When queries are executed, the Query Optimizer can utilize the materialized views to deliver faster query performance since the data has already been aggregated and stored. This is particularly effective for repetitive and predictable query patterns, as it saves the cost of re-running the same join operations with each query.
25. AWS Glue can catalog data across different AWS services, and Amazon Athena is designed to directly query data in various formats stored in S3 using standard SQL and PartiQL for JSON data. This solution avoids the additional steps of data transformation and leverages the managed services to handle the data querying, minimizing the overhead.
- AWS Glue can automatically catalog the data stored in Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, and Amazon Redshift, which simplifies the management of metadata. Amazon Athena allows data scientists to run ad-hoc queries using standard SQL for structured data like CSV files.
- For the JSON format data, Athena supports querying using PartiQL, which is an SQL-compatible query language that extends SQL to include semi-structured and nested data, hence it can handle JSON data efficiently.
