1. S3 Event Notifications can be configured to trigger automatically when new files are added or existing files are modified. By setting up event notifications to invoke a processing job in AWS Batch, the logistics company can efficiently process only the new or updated tracking records.
- AWS Batch can handle the job scheduling, execution, and resource management, making it a cost-effective and operationally efficient solution for processing data at regular intervals
- AWS Glue crawlers are primarily used for schema detection and metadata cataloging, not for processing individual file changes.
2. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service known for its ability to handle large amounts of unstructured data. It provides seamless scalability which means it can automatically adjust to the incoming traffic and data volume, making it ideal for unpredictable traffic patterns.
- DynamoDBs flexible schema allows for handling a variety of user-generated content without the need for predefined schema constraints. This makes it a highly suitable choice for the mobile application described, considering their need for cost-efficiency and performance.
- Amazon RDS is a relational database service that is best for structured data requiring complex queries and transactions. While it offers the robustness of ACID transactions, it may not be as cost-effective or as easily scalable as DynamoDB for unpredictable workloads with a flexible schema requirement.
3. Amazon Macie is the most suitable service for the financial institutionâ€™s needs. Macie is a data security service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and classify sensitive data in Amazon S3.
- Amazon Macie is specifically designed to identify and protect sensitive data, such as PII. Macie can assess, audit, and report on the data it finds, making it a powerful tool for ensuring data security and compliance with various data protection regulations.
- Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious or unauthorized behavior.
- AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) is used to protect web applications from common web exploits.
4. AWS DataSync is a data transfer service designed to simplify and accelerate moving large amounts of data between on-premises storage systems (like SMB file shares) and AWS storage services (such as Amazon S3). It is an ideal choice for the company's requirements as it can handle the transfer securely, efficiently, and with minimal operational overhead. DataSync also offers features like scheduling, data validation, and bandwidth throttling, making it well-suited for a seamless migration process.
- AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection to AWS, which can be beneficial for consistent, high-bandwidth data transfer. However, it does not by itself facilitate the data transfer process and would typically be used in conjunction with a data transfer service like DataSync.
5. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) is designed for data that is less frequently accessed but requires rapid access when needed. Transitioning to S3 Standard-IA after 6 months is cost-effective for the occasional access pattern.
- After 2 years, when the data is rarely accessed, moving it to S3 Glacier Deep Archive offers the lowest storage cost for long-term archiving, while still maintaining data availability, albeit with longer retrieval times.
6. S3 Object Lambda allows you to add custom code to process data retrieved from S3 before returning it to an application. This service is ideal for the company's requirement to dynamically resize images on-the-fly.
- When an application requests an image, S3 Object Lambda can invoke a Lambda function to modify the image (e.g., resize it) based on the specific needs of the application.
7. Concurrency scaling is a feature specific to Redshift that automatically adds additional cluster capacity when needed to handle bursts in a query load. This feature is particularly useful for unpredictable workloads and can be enabled directly in the Redshift cluster's WLM settings.
- Elastic Resize changes the number of nodes in a Redshift cluster, which can scale the cluster's compute resources. However, it is not the same as concurrency scaling, which specifically addresses the need to scale read and write capacity on-demand without resizing the cluster.
8. Implement Amazon Athena, leveraging its integration with AWS Glue Data Catalog for handling schema changes and querying data in S3. This setup enables the e-commerce company to handle schema variations in their product catalog data without the need to set up and manage a traditional database infrastructure.
9. AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that can be used to prepare and transform data for analytics. It is well-suited for processing large volumes of data, such as player activity logs, and can easily read and write data in Amazon S3.
- After transforming and aggregating the data, storing the results in Amazon Redshift, a data warehousing service, allows for efficient querying and generation of daily reports. Redshift is optimized for handling large datasets and complex queries, making it an ideal choice for storing aggregated data for reporting purposes.
10. Use S3 Event Notifications to directly invoke the Lambda function when a new video is uploaded. It can be configured to trigger a Lambda function automatically when a new object is uploaded to an S3 bucket.
11. S3 Standard is ideal for "Project Alpha" data due to its high availability and immediate access, even if the data becomes infrequently accessed after the initial 30 days.
- For "Project Beta" archival data, S3 Glacier Deep Archive offers the lowest cost storage for data that is rarely accessed, and retrieval times of several hours are acceptable in this case
12. Amazon Athena's CTAS feature allows the team to create a new table from the results of a SELECT query on an existing table. This approach is efficient for summarizing and aggregating large datasets stored in Amazon S3.
- The CTAS operation in Athena enables the creation of a summarized table based on specific aggregation criteria, such as sales data by region and product category. It's a serverless option that requires no infrastructure management, making it a convenient and cost-effective solution for the team's requirements.
13. Using S3 as a data lake for EMR is a common best practice because S3 provides highly durable storage at a lower cost compared to HDFS on EMR. S3 also decouples storage from compute, allowing teams to shut down EMR clusters when not in use and avoid paying for persistent HDFS on EMR nodes, thus optimizing costs.
- AWS Graviton instances, which are powered by Arm-based processors, offer a better price-performance ratio compared to traditional x86-based instances. They are designed to deliver cost savings and are optimized for performance, making them a good choice for running cost-optimized and performance-intensive big data workloads on EMR.
14. Use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) for data migration and AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) for schema conversion.
- AWS DMS is an ideal service for migrating databases with minimal downtime. It supports various source and target databases, including Oracle and Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. AWS DMS efficiently migrates data from the existing database to the target database on AWS.
- For the schema conversion, the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) helps convert the source database schema to be compatible with the target database, in this case, Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. SCT assesses the source database, automatically converts the schema to the target format, and highlights any elements that require manual conversion, ensuring a comprehensive migration process.
15. S3 Select allows the data engineer to retrieve a subset of data from an object using simple SQL expressions. By enabling the querying of just the needed column directly within the S3 service, S3 Select minimizes the operational overhead.
- There is no need for provisioning compute resources or setting up additional services; the data can be filtered directly from the S3 bucket. This service is particularly useful for one-time tasks where a full-fledged ETL (extract, transform, load) process is not required.
16. Add a `LEFT JOIN` with another table that lists all customers, ensuring inclusion of customers with zero interactions. This approach is particularly effective in scenarios where the primary data table (interaction_data in this case) might not include all relevant entities - for example, customers who had no interactions in the specified time frame.
- By joining the interaction data with a complete list of customers, the query ensures that all customers are accounted for in the results, regardless of whether they had interactions in 2023 or not. This method is especially useful in analytics and reporting to provide a comprehensive view of the data, including showing customers with zero interactions.
17. Create an AWS Lambda function using Python, triggered by API Gateway, to run the script and return the response. The infrastructure management is fully handled by AWS, which means no server maintenance worries for the startup. This setup not only simplifies the deployment process but also guarantees that the backend can handle varying loads, making it a suitable choice for applications with unpredictable traffic patterns.
18. Apache Parquet is a columnar storage file format optimized for analytics querying, particularly with Amazon Athena. It allows efficient storage and retrieval by enabling queries to scan only the necessary columns, rather than entire rows.
- This leads to faster query performance and reduced costs, especially for large datasets where only a subset of columns is frequently accessed. AWS Glue can be used to automate the conversion of .csv files to Parquet and store them in S3, making this process efficient and scalable.
19. AWS Glue DataBrew is a visual data preparation tool that allows data engineers to clean and normalize data without writing code.
- DataBrew can directly access data stored in S3, and with its recipe feature, the data engineer can easily create and run transformations such as concatenating columns and calculating distinct values.
20. AWS Lake Formation simplifies and centralizes the setup of a secure data lake in AWS. It provides granular access control to data stored in Amazon S3, allowing organizations to define who has access to specific rows and columns within their datasets.
- Lake Formation integrates seamlessly with Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift Spectrum, and Apache Hive on Amazon EMR, providing the least operational overhead while meeting the organization's access control requirements.
21. Columnar storage formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for analytics and can significantly speed up queries because they allow Redshift Spectrum to read only the necessary columns for a query rather than entire rows. This reduces the amount of data scanned and improves performance.
- Partitioning data on commonly used query predicates allows Redshift Spectrum to skip over irrelevant parts of the dataset, which can greatly improve query performance. By scanning only the relevant partitions, less data is processed, leading to faster query execution.
22. Configuring an outbound security group rule for the EC2 instancesâ€™ security group allows the application servers to initiate communication with the RDS instance on the specified database port.
- Setting an inbound security group rule for the RDS security group to allow traffic from the EC2 instancesâ€™ security group ensures that only the application servers can access the database, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
23. By converting to Parquet, the data engineer can reduce the number of bytes that Athena needs to read, which can significantly impact the performance of queries, especially those that do not need to scan entire tables.
- Athena's partition projection can help manage many partitions by projecting them into the query results as if they were there, without the need to perform operations on the actual metadata in the Glue Data Catalog. This also speeds up query execution time because Athena spends less time reading the partition metadata.
24. AWS Lambda is an effective serverless computing service that can be directly triggered by Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. It is ideal for real-time data processing tasks such as enriching streaming data by making API calls to external services. After enrichment, Lambda can then seamlessly store the data in Amazon S3.
25. Use Lambda functions triggered by API Gateway to handle photo uploads and retrievals with S3.
- This approach is ideal for the mobile app development company. Using Amazon API Gateway in conjunction with AWS Lambda provides several benefits. API Gateway acts as a front door to manage all the API calls, ensuring scalability, security, and efficiency. API Gateway allows the company to control access to their S3 operations, manage traffic, authorize requests, and handle different versions of the API.
- AWS Lambda can process the upload and retrieval requests, interfacing with Amazon S3 as needed. This serverless architecture is cost-effective and scales automatically with the number of requests, making it well-suited for a mobile application handling varying loads.
