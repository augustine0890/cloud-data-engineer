1. In Amazon SQS, there are several events can lead to the removal of messages:
- A `DeleteMessage` API call is a direct method to remove a message from the queue, typically after it has processed by a consumer.
- Reaching the `maxReceiveCount` for a message is another way messages are removed. This occurs when a message has been received a specified number of times out but not deleted. The results in the message being sent to a dead-letter queue.
- Performing a purge operation on the queue instantly clears all messages, useful for resetting or troubleshooting the queue.
