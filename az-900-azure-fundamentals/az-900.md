# AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

### Regions and Availability Zones
- Most Azure Regions have at least 3 AZs. However, it's important to remember that NOT all Azure regions have Availability Zones.
- Each Availability Zone has one or more discrete data centers.
- Availability Zones in a region are connected through low-latency links.
- Create multiple instances in multiple AZs if you want high availability.

### Azure Virtual Machines
- Commands:
```bash
chmod 400 my-first-vm_key.pem
ssh -i YOUR_KEY_PATH azureuser@PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS
ssh -i my-first-vm_key.pem azureuser@PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS

apt-get -y update
apt-get -y install nginx
```
- Static IP Address: assign a fixed IP address to your VM Public IP address is charged per IP per hour.
- Availability: are the applications available when your users need them --> availability sets and scale sets.
Scalability: can we handle a growth in users, traffic, or data size without any drop in performance --> VM Size, Scale Sets and Load Balancers.
- Disaster Recovery: how to keep your systems running in face of disasters --> Site Recovery.
- Resilience: ability of system to provide acceptable behavior even when one or more parts of the system fail.
- Azure Disks: Block storage (hard disks) for Azure VMs.
