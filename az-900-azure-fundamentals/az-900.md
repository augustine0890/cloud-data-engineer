# AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

### Regions and Availability Zones
- Most Azure Regions have at least 3 AZs. However, it's important to remember that NOT all Azure regions have Availability Zones.
- Each Availability Zone has one or more discrete data centers.
- Availability Zones in a region are connected through low-latency links.
- Create multiple instances in multiple AZs if you want high availability.

### Azure Virtual Machines
- Commands:
```bash
chmod 400 my-first-vm_key.pem
ssh -i YOUR_KEY_PATH azureuser@PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS
ssh -i my-first-vm_key.pem azureuser@PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS

apt-get -y update
apt-get -y install nginx
```
- Static IP Address: assign a fixed IP address to your VM Public IP address is charged per IP per hour.
- Availability: are the applications available when your users need them --> availability sets and scale sets.
Scalability: can we handle a growth in users, traffic, or data size without any drop in performance --> VM Size, Scale Sets and Load Balancers.
- Disaster Recovery: how to keep your systems running in face of disasters --> Site Recovery.
- Resilience: ability of system to provide acceptable behavior even when one or more parts of the system fail.
- Azure Disks: Block storage (hard disks) for Azure VMs.

### Managed Compute Services
- Container Orchestration:
    - Auto Scaling: scale containers based on demand
    - Service Discovery: help microservices find one another
    - Load Balancer: distributed load among multiple instances of a microservice.
    - Self healing: do health checks and replace failing instances.
- Azure VMs: IaaS, use VMs when you need control over OS Or you want to run custom software. You handle availability, scalability, load balancing, software/OS updates...
- Azure App Service: PaaS, deploy web apps, mobile back-end and RESTful APIs quickly. Built-in Auto Scaling, Load Balancing.
- Azure Container Instances: PaaS, run insolated containers, without orchestration. You do NOT need to provision and manage VMs. Start containers in seconds.
- Azure Functions: Serverless (FaaS) compute for event-driven apps.

### Azure Storage
- High available, durable and massively scalable.
- Core storage services:
    - Disks: block storage (hard disks) for Azure VMs
    - Files: file shares for cloud and on-premises.
    - Blobs: object store for text and binary data
    - Queues: decouple applications using messaging
    - Tables: NoSQL store
- Azure Storage Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) stores three synchronous copies in same data center (AZ). It does not replicate across multiple AZs.
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2: Azure Blob Storage Enhanced.
- Azure Storage Explorer: manage Azure storage resources from desktop.
    - Extensions available: Data Factory extn - move data from AWS S3 to Azure Storage.
    - AzCopy (alternative):  command-line utility.

### Azure Databases
- Take a snapshot: copy of the database
- Add a standby database in the second data center with replication:
    - You can switch to the standby database when database will be go down.
    - Take a from standby, applications connecting to master will get good performance always.
- Durability: multiple copies of data (standbys, snapshots, transaction logs and replicas) in multiple zones, regions
- Availability: multiple standbys available or distribute the database in multiple zones, regions.    
```bash
mysql --host=mysql-server-mlops.mysql.database.azure.com --user=mysqlserver -p
```
```sql
create database todos;
use todos;
create table user (id integer, username varchar(30) );
describe user;
insert into user values (1, 'Ranjith');
insert into user values (2, 'Ramesh');
select * from user;
```
- OLTP database use row storage:
    - Each table row is stored together
    - Efficient for processing small transactions
- OLAP (Online Analytics Processing)
    - High compression: store data efficiently
    - Analyze petabytes of data
    - Data is consolidated from multiple (transactional) databases
    - Azure Synapse Analytics: petabyte-scale distributed data warehouse.
        - Enables MPP (massively parallel processing)
    - Execute single query across multiple nodes: complex queries can be executed efficiently.
- A start up with quickly evolving schema (table structure) --> Cosmos DB
- Single-digit millisecond response times for global application with millions of users --> CosmosDB
- Transactional local database processing thousands of transactions per second --> Azure SQL Database
- Cache data for a web application --> Azure Cache
- Database for analytics processing of petabyes of data --> Azure Synapse Analytics
