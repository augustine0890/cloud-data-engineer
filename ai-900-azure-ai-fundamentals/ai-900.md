## Artificial Intelligence on Microsoft Azure

## Understand Responsible AI
- Fairness is meant to ensure that AI models do not unintentionally incorporate a bias based on criteria such as gender or ethnicity. The AI system must be designed to ensure that biased decision-making is avoided and not based on factors such as ethnicity and gender.
- The accountability principle ensures that AI systems are designed to meet any ethical and legal standards that are applicable. The privacy and security principle states that AI systems must be designed to protect any personal and/or sensitive data. The inclusiveness principle states that AI systems must empower people in a positive and engaging way. The fairness principle is applied to AI a system to ensure that users of the systems are treated fairly.
- The reliability and safety principles are of paramount importance here as it requires an AI system to work alongside people in a physical environment by using AI controlled machinery. The system must function safely, while ensuring no harm will come to human life.

## Natural Language Processing
- Vectorization captures semantic relationships between words by assigning them to locations in n-dimensional space. Lemmatization, also known as stemming, normalizes words before counting them. N-grams extend frequency analysis to include multi-term phrases.
- Removing stops words is the first in the statistical analysis of terms used in a text in the context of NLP:
  - Counting the occurrences of each takes place after stop words are removed.
  - Creating a vectorized model is not part of statistical analysis. It's used to capture the sematic relationship between words.
  - Encoding words as numeric features is not part of statistical analysis. It's frequently used in sentiment analysis.
- The Azure AI Speech service can be used to generate spoken audio from a text source for text-to-speech translation.
- The Universal Language Model used by the speech-to-text API is optimized for conversational and dictation scenarios. The acoustic, language, and pronunciation scenarios require developing your own model.
- The Azure AI Translator service supports text-to-text translation, but it does not support speech-to-text, text-to-speech, or speech-to-speech translation.
- Entity Linking, PII detection, and sentiment analysis are all elements of the Azure AI Service for Azure AI Language.
- Azure AI Vision deals with image processing. Azure AI Content Moderator is an Azure AI Services service used to check text, image, and video content for material that is potentially offensive.

## Fundamentals of Machine Learning
- Multiple linear regression models a relationship between two or more features and a single label. Linear regression uses a single feature.
- Logistic regression is a type of classification model, which returns either a Boolean value or a categorical decision.
- Hierarchical clustering groups data points that have similar characteristics.
